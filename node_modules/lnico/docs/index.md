# Lnico

Lnico is a front-end friendly static site generator, best for web developers like you and me.

-----------

Ever want to build a static site? Don't fancy Python, Ruby or any other languages? Just like you, I do like javascript, and node made it so fun.

Lnico is written in javascript, using what you are familiar with makes you happy. You are able to change things, you are able to make a difference.


## Documentation

Documentation is available in these languages:

- [English](./en/)
- [简体中文](./zh/)


## Quality

The concept is borrowed from [liquidluck](http://lab.lepture.com/liquidluck/) with a little improvement. It should works like liquidluck, and it really did. I eat my own dog food, this site is built by lnico.

The code of lnico is well tested, and you can add more test case for this project.
